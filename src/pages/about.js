            <p className="display left semibold">I'm currently a Senior Product Designer at <span className="link">GoodRx</span> building <span className="link">Provider Mode</span> for healthcare professionals helping their patients access, afford, and adhere to their medications.</p>
            <p className="body left">During the holidays, people often ask me the same question: What do you do for work? I've never had a clear answer, and it changes depending on who's asking. Here's a couple things top of mind right now.</p>
            <p className="body left">I love tinkering with things in Figma ‚Äî especially creating foundations for others to elevate their products. Some of the recent things I‚Äôve released to the community are a flexible <span className="link">skeleton loading kit </span> and a basic <span className="link">iMessage kit</span>. You can check out some other doodads on my <span className="link">profile</span>.</p>
            <p className="body left">At <a href="https://www.heydoctor.co" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" className="link">HeyDoctor</a> (now GoodRx Care) I led design for the Electronic Medical Record (EMR). It was a complex platform operating at the center of diagnosis, treatment, and customer support. My team supported growth from 100 to 1,000+ telehealth visits per day. I also led design for a team who‚Äôs soul purpose was improving the visit experience for our patients. We reimagined how our video consultations work, and it turned out pretty well. We won an <a href="https://www.digitalhealthhub.org/awards/2020/winners" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" className="link">award</a> for Best Telehealth Company in 2020.</p>
            <p className="body left">Recently I‚Äôve taken GoodRx Provider Mode from an idea to one of the largest provider platforms in the United States. We released a <a href="https://investors.goodrx.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" className="link">video</a> for our investors and the public to learn more about it.</p>

            <p className="display left semibold">Okay enough with the work talk...</p>
            <p className="body left">One of the lockdown hobbies I picked up is disc golf ü•è. I also got myself a set of cornhole boards and bags to hustle fellow beer drinkers on the weekends. Hit me up if you live close and want to play.</p>
            <p className="body left">I was one of the many thousand who explored bread science during our hibernation in 2020. I got pretty good at making brioche buns, and haven‚Äôt stopped iterating on pizza dough. You could say the kitchen island is my new creative frontier.</p>
