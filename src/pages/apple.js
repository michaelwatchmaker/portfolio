          <h2>Hi Apple üëãüèº</h2>
          <p className="display semibold">My name is <Link className="link" to="/">Michael Watchmaker</Link>, a Senior Product Designer at GoodRx. I‚Äôm eager to work together on building beautiful and powerful experiences for clinicians ‚Äî something I‚Äôve been working towards at GoodRx and HeyDoctor for the last 4.5 years.</p>
          <p className="body regular">One of the most challenging parts of working in healthcare as a designer is dealing with complexity of concepts, lack of interoperability, and evolving compliance standards. I‚Äôve grown tired of working within an ancient system where I‚Äôm told ‚Äúit is the way it is‚Äù and believe the team at Apple is where I can help break down some of the barriers keeping clinical software stuck in the past.</p>

My background working in highly ambiguous clinical environments, coupled with a track record of business success makes me excited to define a new bar for what healthcare software can be.</p>
